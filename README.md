# Wordle clone built with React

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Improvements

- You're currently not limited to 6 guesses
  - If this is resolved, present user with the correct word at the end
- Parameterize length of word and number of guesses
- Hard mode (do not show in-word but only if correct position)
- Better dictionary
